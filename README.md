# BitHub
A homemade GitHub clone from a GitHub fan.

## Introduction

> We ❤️ GitHub, which is (most likely) why we are here. 

In this project, which serves mainly for learning purpose, we aim to build a GitHub clone
based on [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc).

##  Goals

In our initial plan, we intend to re-create the functionalities as well as the look and feel
of the tabs you see in the repository page: `Code`, `Issues`, `Pull requests`.
